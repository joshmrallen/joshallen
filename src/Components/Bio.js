                <p>I'm an optimistic Software Engineer and father with a passion for languages, music, and life. My experience has been with using Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and React frameworks to create full stack web applications.</p>
                <p>Many know me as a helpful person who enjoys walking through problems and learning new programming languages and technology. I've worked for start-ups as well as large companies where I developed key prioritization, collaboration, leadership, and effective problem solving skills. In the past, co-workers have frequently come to me as their "go-to" for problems they needed help with.</p>
